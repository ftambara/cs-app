> A car manufacturing company has promised their customers that the next
release of a new engine will show a 4× performance improvement. You have been
assigned the task of delivering on that promise. You have determined that only
90% of the engine can be improved. How much (i.e., what value of k) would you
need to improve this part to meet the overall performance target of the engine?

S = 4
α = .9

As it was shown in Problem 1.1, k is:
k = α / (1/S - 1 + α)
k = .9 / (.25 - 1 + .9) = 6

The 90% of the engine that could be improved should be sped up by a factor of 6
to get the desired total speed up of 4 times.
