> Suppose you work as a truck driver, and you have been hired to carry a load
of potatoes from Boise, Idaho, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, a total distance of
2,500 kilometers. You estimate you can average 100 km/hr driving within the
speed limits, requiring a total of 25 hours for the trip.

> A. You hear on the news that Montana has just abolished its speed limit,
which constitutes 1,500 km of the trip. Your truck can travel at 150 km/hr.
What will be your speedup for the trip?

There is an error in the statement.
```
vAVG = (vM lM + vR lR)/(lM + lR)
```
where
    - vAVG is the average velocity
    - vM is the velocity through Montana
    - vR is the velocity through the rest of the route
    - lM is the lengh of the route through Montana
    - lR is the lengh of the rest of the route

From that formula, in the case of the OLD datum, we have two unknowns:
vM and vR, so we don't have vM_OLD.
Since k = vM_NEW / vM_OLD, we can't know k.

If we assume vM_OLD is 100 km/h for the sake of solving the exercise:

```
k = 150/100 = 1.5
α = 1500/2500 = 0.6

S = 1/(1-α + α/k) = 1/(.4 + .6/1.5) = 1.25
```

The speedup for the whole trip is 1.25 times.

> B. You can buy a new turbocharger for your truck at www.fasttrucks.com. They
stock a variety of models, but the faster you want to go, the more it will
cost. How fast must you travel through Montana to get an overall speedup for
your trip of 1.67×?

```
S = 1.67
α = .6
```

The speedup, again, is:
```
S = 1/(1-α + α/k)
```

Moving things around we get:
```
α/k = 1/S - 1 + α
k = α / (1/S - 1 + α)
```
Which gives
```
k = .6 / (1/1.67 - 1 + .6)
k ~= 3.02

vM_NEW = k vM_OLD
vM_NEW ~= 302 km/h
```

We must travel at around 300 km/h through Montana
