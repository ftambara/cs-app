> Without converting the numbers to decimal or binary, try to solve the following
arithmetic problems, giving the answers in hexadecimal. Hint: Just modify the
methods you use for performing decimal addition and subtraction to use base 16.


```
A. 0x605c + 0x5 = 0x6061
B. 0x605c − 0x20 = 0x603c
C. 0x605c + 32 = 0x605c + 0x20 = 0x607c
D. 0x60fa − 0x605c = 0x60e0 - 0x6050 + (0x1a - 0xc)
                   = 0x90 + (0xf + 0x1 + 0xa - 0xc)
                   = 0x90 + 0xe = 0x9e
```
