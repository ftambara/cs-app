> What would be printed as a result of the following call to show_bytes?
```c
const char *m = "mnopqr";
show_bytes((byte_pointer) m, strlen(m));
```
> Note that letters ‘a’ through ‘z’ have ASCII codes 0x61 through 0x7A.

```
 a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z
61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 6A 6B 6C 6D 6E 6F 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 7A
```

Show bytes whoud print:
```
6D 6E 6F 70 71 72 (not 00, since strlen does not include it in the count)
```
