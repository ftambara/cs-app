> Suppose that a and b have byte values 0x55 and 0x46, respectively. Fill in
the following table indicating the byte values of the different C expressions:

```
a = 0101 0101
~a = 1010 1010 = AA

b = 0100 0110
~b = 1011 1001 = B9
```

```
Expression  Value
-----------------------------
a & b       0100 0100 = 0x44
a | b       0101 0111 = 0x57
~a | ~b     1011 1011 = 0xBB*
a & !b       a & 0x00 = 0x00
a && b                  0x01
a || b                  0x01
!a || !b                0x00
a && ~b                 0x01
```

> [^*] If a and b are ints, this response would change. Specifically, instead of
being 0xBB with leading zeros, it would have leading 'F's.
