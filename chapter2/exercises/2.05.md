> Consider the following three calls to show_bytes:
```c
int a = 0x12345678;
byte_pointer ap = (byte_pointer) &a;
show_bytes(ap, 1); /* A. */
show_bytes(ap, 2); /* B. */
show_bytes(ap, 3); /* C. */
```
> Indicate the values that will be printed by each call on a little-endian
machine and on a big-endian machine:

a = 0x 12 34 56 78

```
A. Little endian: 78        Big endian: 12
B. Little endian: 78 56     Big endian: 12 34
C. Little endian: 78 56 34  Big endian: 12 34 56
```
