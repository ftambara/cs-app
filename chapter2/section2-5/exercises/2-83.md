> Consider numbers having a binary representation consisting of an infinite
string of the form 0.yyyyyy..., where y is a k-bit sequence. For example, the
binary representation of 1/3 is 0.01010101... (y = 01), while the representation
of 1/5 is 0.001100110011... (y = 0011).

> A. Let Y = B2U_k(y), that is, the number having binary representation y. Give
a formula in terms of Y and k for the value represented by the infinite string.
Hint: Consider the effect of shifting the binary point k positions to the right.

```
Y = sum(sum(y_i * 2^-(kj+i), j=0, inf), i=-1, i=-k)
```
Where:
    `y_i` is the i-th bit of `Y`
    `k` is the length of `Y`
    `i` and `j` are the bit numbers from different counts

The internal sum is a geometric series. In closed form:
```
Y = sum((y_i * 2^-i) / (1 - 2^-k), i=-1, i=-k)
Y = sum((y_i * 2^-i), i=-1, i=-k) / (1 - 2^-k)
```

> B. What is the numeric value of the string for the following values of y?
(a) 101
(b) 0110
(c) 010011

(a)
```
1 - 2^-k = 7/8
Y = (2^-1 + 2^-3) / 7/8 = 5/7
```

(b)
```
1 - 2^-k = 15/16
Y = (2^-2 + 2^-3) / 15/16 = 6/15 = 2/5
```

(c)
```
1 - 2^-k = 63/64
Y = (2^-2 + 2^-5 + 2^-6) / 63/64 = 19/63
```
