> A. In what way does our code fail to comply with the C standard?

Shifting by either negative amounts or amounts greater or equal than the number
of bits in the value is undefined behavior ([source](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operations_in_C#Right_shift_%3E%3E)).

> B. Modify the code to run properly on any machine for which data type int is
at least 32 bits.

```c
/* The following code does not run properly on some machines */
int int_size_is_32() {
    /* Set most significant bit (msb) of 32-bit machine */
    int set_msb = 1 << 31;
    /* Shift past msb of 32-bit word */
    int beyond_msb = (1 << 31) << 1;

    /* set_msb is nonzero when word size >= 32
       beyond_msb is zero when word size <= 32 */
    return set_msb && !beyond_msb;
}
```

> C. Modify the code to run properly on any machine for which data type int is
at least 16 bits.

```c
/* The following code does not run properly on some machines */
int int_size_is_32() {
    /* Set most significant bit (msb) of 32-bit machine */
    int set_msb = ((1 << 15) << 15) << 1;
    /* Shift past msb of 32-bit word */
    int beyond_msb = ((1 << 15) << 15) << 2;

    /* set_msb is nonzero when word size >= 32
       beyond_msb is zero when word size <= 32 */
    return set_msb && !beyond_msb;
}
```
