> Around 250 B.C., the Greek mathematician Archimedes proved that
223/71 < π < 22/7. Had he had access to a computer and the standard library
<math.h>, he would have been able to determine that the single-precision
floating-point approximation of π has the hexadecimal representation 0x40490FDB.
Of course, all of these are just approximations, since π is not rational.

> A. What is the fractional binary number denoted by this floating-point value?

```
s  e          f
0  1000 0000  100 1001 0000 1111 1101 1011
```
e = 2^7 => E = 2^7 - 127 = 1
f = 0x490FDB = 4788187
M = 1 + f/2^23 ≈ 1.5708
V ≈ 3.14159274

> B. What is the fractional binary representation of 22/7? Hint: See
Problem 2.83.

22/7 = 3 + 1/7
By looking at problem 2.83, it's clear that denominator 7 is one of the
cases for periodic binary numbers.
```
22/7_2 = 11.[001]
```

> C. At what bit position (relative to the binary point) do these two
approximations to π diverge?

```
22/7_2:             11.00100100100100...
float(0x40490FDB):   1 0010010000111111011011
                               ^
                        first different bit
```
They diverge 9 bits after the binary point.
