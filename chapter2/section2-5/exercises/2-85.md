> Given a floating-point format with a k-bit exponent and an n-bit fraction,
write formulas for the exponent E, the significand M, the fraction f, and the
value V for the quantities that follow. In addition, describe the bit
representation.

`x = (-1)^s 2^E M`
`bias = 2^(k-1)-1`

For normalized values:
```
E = e-bias
M = 1 + f/(2^n)
```

For denormalized values:
```
E = 1-bias
M = f/(2^n)
```

> A. The number 7.0

```
s = 0
E >= 0

If k >= 2:
    U2B(f) = 11[0]
    f = 2^n-1 + 2^n-2
    M = 1 + f = 1 + 2^-1 + 2^-2 = = 7/4
    E = 2
    V = 7

If k == 1 || k == 0:
    Between 6 and 8, x will be rounded to 8 which is even up to the
    higher bit position
    f = 0
    M = 1
    E = 3
    V = 8
```

> B. The largest odd integer that can be represented exactly

```
s = 0
If 2^k >= n:
    U2B(f) = [1]
    f = 2^n - 1
    M = 1 + f/(2^n) = 1 + (2^n - 1) / (2^n) = 2 - 2^-n
    E = n
    V = 2^n (2 - 2^-n) = 2^n+1 - 1

If 2^k < n:
    E = 2^k - 1 - bias = 2^k - 2^(k-1)
    U2B(f) = 111...000...
    f = (2^E - 1) * 2^(n-E) = 2^n - 2^(E-n)
    M = 1 + f/(2^n) = 1 + (2^n - 2^(E-n)) / 2^n = 2 - 2^(E-2n)
    V = (2 - 2^(E-2n)) * 2^E = 2^(E+1) - 2^2(E-n)
```

> C. The reciprocal of the smallest positive normalized value

Smallest positive normalized value:
```
s = 0
E = 1-(2^(k-1) - 1) = -2^(k-1) + 2
f = 0
V = 2^E = 2^(-2^(k-1) + 2)
```

The value of the reciprocal must be
```
V = 2^-(-2^(k-1) + 2) = 2^(2^(k-1) - 2)
```
Therefore
```
s = 0
M = 1
E = 2^(k-1) - 2
e = 2^(k-1) - 2 + bias = 2^k - 3
```
