/* Suppose we want to compute the complete 2w-bit representation of x.y, where
 * both x and y are unsigned, on a machine for which data type unsigned is w
 * bits. The low-order w bits of the product can be computed with the expression
 * x*y, so we only require a procedure with prototype
 *
 * unsigned unsigned_high_prod(unsigned x, unsigned y);
 *
 * that computes the high-order w bits of x.y for unsigned variables.
 * We have access to a library function with prototype
 *
 * int signed_high_prod(int x, int y);
 *
 * that computes the high-order w bits of x.y for the case where x and y are
 * in twoâ€™s-complement form. Write code calling this procedure to implement the
 * function for unsigned arguments. Justify the correctness of your solution.
 * Hint: Look at the relationship between the signed product x.y and the
 * unsigned product x'.y' in the derivation of Equation 2.18.
