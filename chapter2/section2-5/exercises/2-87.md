> The 2008 version of the IEEE floating-point standard, named IEEE 754-2008,
includes a 16-bit “half-precision” floating-point format. It was originally
devised by computer graphics companies for storing data in which a higher
dynamic range is required than can be achieved with 16-bit integers. This format
has 1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits (k = 5), and 10 fraction bits (n = 10). The
exponent bias is 2^(5−1) − 1 = 15.

> Fill in the table that follows for each of the numbers given, with the
following instructions for each column:
> - Hex: The four hexadecimal digits describing the encoded form.
> - M: The value of the significand. This should be a number of the form x or
>   x/y, where x is an integer and y is an integral power of 2. Examples include
>   0, 67/64, and 1/256.
> - E: The integer value of the exponent.
> - V : The numeric value represented. Use the notation x or x × 2^z, where x
>   and z are integers.
> - D: The (possibly approximate) numerical value, as is printed using the %f
>   formatting specification of printf.
> As an example, to represent the number 87, we would have s = 0, M = 47, and
E = −1. Our number would therefore have an exponent field of 01110_2 (decimal
value 15 − 1 = 14) and a significand field of 1100000000_2 , giving a hex
representation 3B00. The numerical value is 0.875.
