> You just started working for a company that is implementing a set of
procedures to operate on a data structure where 4 signed bytes are packed into a
32-bit unsigned. Bytes within the word are numbered from 0 (least significant)
to 3 (most significant). You have been assigned the task of implementing a
function for a machine using twoâ€™s-complement arithmetic and arithmetic right
shifts with the following prototype:
> ```c
> /* Declaration of data type where 4 bytes are packed into an unsigned */
> typedef unsigned packed_t;
> 
> /* Extract byte from word. Return as signed integer */
> int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum);
> ```
>
> That is, the function will extract the designated byte and sign extend it to be
a 32-bit int.
Your predecessor (who was fired for incompetence) wrote the following code:

> ```c
> /* Failed attempt at xbyte */
> int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum)
> {
>    return (word >> (bytenum << 3)) & 0xFF;

> A. What is wrong with this code?

The sign extension doesn't work. The mask that's being applyied always puts
zeros in the left positions, even if ones are needed.

> B. Give a correct implementation of the function that uses only left and right
shifts, along with one subtraction.

```c
/* Failed attempt at xbyte */
int xbyte(packed_t word, int bytenum) {
    /* 
     * Use C's built-in arithmetic shift for ints:
     * Shift the target byte all the way to the left, and then place it
     * at the rightmost position.
     * The last two shift operations could be avoided by adding the
     * amounts to shift.
     */
    int left_shift = 8*(3 - bytenum);
    return ((word << left_shift) >> left_shift) >> (8*bytenum);
}
```
