> Using the table you filled in when solving Problem 2.17, fill in the
following table describing the function T2U_4:

```
Hexadecimal Binary  BtU4(x)     BtT4(x)
0xA         [1010]  8+2 = 10    -8+2 = -6
0x1         [0001]  1           1
0xB         [1011]  8+2+1 = 11  -8+2+1 = -5
0x2         [0010]  2           2
0x7         [0111]  7           7
0xC         [1100]  8+4 = 12    -8+4 = -4
```

```
x   TtU_4(x)
−1  15
−5  11
−6  10
−4  12
 1  1
 8  8
 ```

 > Note: Used the fact that the sum of the absolute values of the two's
 complement and the unsigned interpretations adds to 2^w (w = number of bits).

 > Note2: The table of exercise 2.17 was wrong. It's seems to be a problem with
 the global edition
