> In Chapter 3, we will look at listings generated by a disassembler, a program
that converts an executable program file back to a more readable ASCII form.
These files contain many hexadecimal numbers, typically representing values in
two’s-complement form. Being able to recognize these numbers and understand
their significance (for example, whether they are negative or positive) is an
important skill.
For the lines labeled A–I (on the right) in the following listing, convert the
hexadecimal values (in 32-bit two’s-complement form) shown to the right of the
instruction names (sub, mov, and add) into their decimal equivalents:

```
sub		$0x2e0,%rsp                 0x2e0 = 0000 0010 1110 0000 = 736
mov		-0x58(%rsp),%rax            -0x58 = 0000 0000 0101 1000 = -88
add		0x28(%rdi),%rax              0x28 = 0000 0000 0010 1000 =  40
mov		%rax,-0x30(%rsp)            -0x30 = 0000 0000 0011 0000 = -48
mov		0x78(%rsp),%rax              0x78 = 0000 0000 0111 1000 = 120
mov		%rax,0x88(%rdi)              0x88 = 0000 0000 1000 1000 = 136
mov		0x1f8(%rsp),%rax            0x1f8 = 0000 0001 1111 1000 = 504

add		0x8(%rsp),%rax
mov		%rax,0xc0(%rsp)              0xc8 = 0000 0000 1100 1000 = 192

mov		-0x48(%rsp,%rdx,8),%rax     -0x48 = 0000 0000 0100 1000 = -72
```
