> Explain how Equation 2.5 applies to the entries in the table you generated
when solving Problem 2.19.

```
x   TtU_4(x)
−1  15
−5  11
−6  10
−4  12
 1  1
 8  8
 ```

For 4-bit numbers, 2^w = 16.
Each entry can be calculating using the equation that's being referenced.

```
TtU_4(-1) = -1 + 16 = 15
TtU_4(-5) = -5 + 16 = 11
TtU_4(-6) = -6 + 16 = 10
TtU_4(-4) = -4 + 16 = 12
TtU_4(1) = 1
TtU_4(8) = 8
```
