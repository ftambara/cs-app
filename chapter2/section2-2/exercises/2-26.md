> You are given the assignment of writing a function that determines whether
one string is longer than another. You decide to make use of the string library
function `strlen` having the following declaration:
```c
/* Prototype for library function strlen */
size_t strlen(const char *s);
```
Here is your first attempt at the function:
```c
/* Determine whether string s is longer than string t */
/* WARNING: This function is buggy */
int strlonger(char *s, char *t) {
    return strlen(s) - strlen(t) > 0;
}
```
> When you test this on some sample data, things do not seem to work quite
right. You investigate further and determine that, when compiled as a 32-bit
program, data type `size_t` is defined (via `typedef`) in header file `stdio.h`
to be `unsigned`.

> A. For what cases will this function produce an incorrect result?

Whenever `strlen(t) > strlen(s)`. this case will result in an integer
overflow, instead of a negative number as expected.

> B. Explain how this incorrect result comes about.

The arithmetic on the left side of the comparison is done in unsigned type.
Since this type does not allow negative numbers, whenever
`strlen(t) > strlen(s)` we get a bigger than expected result.

> C. Show how to fix the code so that it will work reliably.
```c
// Returning a boolean would be clearer
int strlonger(char *s, char *t) {
    return strlen(s) > strlen(t);
}
```
