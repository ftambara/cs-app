> Suppose we truncate a 4-bit value (represented by hex digits 0 through F) to
a 3-bit value (represented as hex digits 0 through 7.) Fill in the table below
showing the effect of this truncation for some cases, in terms of the unsigned
and twoâ€™s-complement interpretations of those bit patterns.

> Explain how Equations 2.9 and 2.10 apply to these cases.

In the unsigned case, for truncating the original number u, of w = 4 bits, to
u', of k = 3 bits, we can use equation 2.9 to calculate the value of u':

```
BtU_3(0x1) = BtU_4(0x1) mod 8 = 1 mod 8 = 1
BtU_3(0x3) = BtU_4(0x3) mod 8 = 3 mod 8 = 3
BtU_3(0x5) = BtU_4(0x5) mod 8 = 5 mod 8 = 5
BtU_3(0xC) = BtU_4(0xC) mod 8 = 12 mod 8 = 4
BtU_3(0xE) = BtU_4(0xE) mod 8 = 14 mod 8 = 6
```


In the unsigned case, to truncate x, if we use equation 2.10:

```
BtT_3(0x1) = UtT_3(BtU_4(0x1) mod 8) = UtT_3(1) = 1
BtT_3(0x3) = UtT_3(BtU_4(0x3) mod 8) = UtT_3(3) = 3
BtT_3(0x5) = UtT_3(BtU_4(0x5) mod 8) = UtT_3(5) = -3
BtT_3(0xC) = UtT_3(BtU_4(0xC) mod 8) = UtT_3(4) = -4
BtT_3(0xE) = UtT_3(BtU_4(0xE) mod 8) = UtT_3(6) = -2
```
