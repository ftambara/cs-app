> Assuming w = 4, we can assign a numeric value to each possible hexadecimal
digit, assuming either an unsigned or a twoâ€™s-complement interpretation.
Fill in the following table according to these interpretations by writing out
the nonzero powers of 2 in the summations shown in Equations 2.1 and 2.3:

```
Hexadecimal Binary  BtU4(x)     BtT4(x)
0xA         [1010]  8+2 = 10    -8+2 = -6
0x1         [0001]  1           1
0xB         [1011]  8+2+1 = 11  -8+2+1 = -5
0x2         [0010]  2           2
0x7         [0111]  7           7
0xC         [1100]  8+4 = 12    -8+4 = -4
```
