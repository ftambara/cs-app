> Show that each of the following bit vectors is a two’s-complement
representation of −4 by applying Equation 2.3:
A. [1100]
B. [11100]
C. [111100]
Observe that the second and third bit vectors can be derived from the first
by sign extension.

```
A. BtT_4([1100]) = -1*2^3 + 1*2^2 = -4
B. BtT_5([11100]) = -2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 = -4
C. BtT_6([111100]) = -2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 = -4
```
