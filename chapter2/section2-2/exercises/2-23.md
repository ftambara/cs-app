> Consider the following C functions:
```c
int fun1(unsigned word) {
    return (int) ((word << 24) >> 24);
}
int fun2(unsigned word) {
    return ((int) word << 24) >> 24;
}
```
> Assume these are executed as a 32-bit program on a machine that uses
twoâ€™s-complement arithmetic. Assume also that right shifts of signed values are
performed arithmetically, while right shifts of unsigned values are performed
logically.

> A. Fill in the following table showing the effect of these functions for
several example arguments. You will find it more convenient to work with a
hexadecimal representation. Just remember that hex digits 8 through F have
their most significant bits equal to 1.

```
0x00000076
fun1
(int) (0x76000000 >> 24) == 0x00000076 = 118
fun2
((int) 0x76000000) >> 24 == 0x00000076 = 118

0x87654321
fun1
(int) (0x21000000 >> 24) == 0x00000021 = 33
fun2
((int) 0x21000000) >> 24 == 0x00000021 == 33

0x000000C9
fun1
(int) (0xC9000000 >> 24) == 0x000000C9 = 201
fun2
((int) 0xC9000000) >> 24 == 0xFFFFFFC9 = -2^8 + 201 = -55

0xEDCBA987
fun1
(int) (0x87000000 >> 24) == 0x00000087 = 135
fun2
((int) 0x87000000) >> 24 == 0xFFFFFF87 = -2^8 + 135 = -121
```

> B. Describe in words the useful computation each of these functions performs.

fun1 extracts the unsigned value of the least 2 significant bytes.
fun2 is a mistery.

> Note: After reading the solution, the 'useful computation' that fun2 performs
is as much of a mistery as it was before.
