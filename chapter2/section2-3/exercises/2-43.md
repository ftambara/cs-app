> In the following code, we have omitted the definitions of constants M and N:

```c
#define M /* Mystery number 1 */
#define N /* Mystery number 2 */
int arith(int x, int y) {
    int result = 0;
    result = x*M + y/N; /* M and N are mystery numbers. */
    return result;
}
```
> We compiled this code for particular values of M and N. The compiler optimized
the multiplication and division using the methods we have discussed. The
following is a translation of the generated machine code back into C:
```c
/* Translation of assembly code for arith */
int optarith(int x, int y) {
    int t = x;
    x <<= 5;
    x -= t;
    if (y < 0) y += 7;
    y >>= 3; /* Arithmetic shift */
    return x+y;
}
```
> What are the values of M and N?

```
t = x
x' = x << 5
x'' = x' - x
if y < 0
    y' = y + 7
else
    y' = y
y'' = y' >> 3
return x'' + y''
```

Translation:
```
x = x<<5 - x
x = x*(2^5 - 1)
x = x*31

y = (y + bias)/2^3 = (y + bias)/8
if y < 0
    bias = 7 = 1<<3 - 1
else
    bias = 0
therefore
y = y/8 as two's complement int

result = x*31 + y/8
M = 31
N = 8
```
