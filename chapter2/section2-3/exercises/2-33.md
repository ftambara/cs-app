> We can represent a bit pattern of length w = 4 with a single hex digit. For a

determine the additive inverses of the digits shown:

T_MIN_4 = -8

They are the same bit patterns, just interpreted defferently. Fascinating.
If you think about it, in both cases we are doing the same thing: finding the
bit pattern that, when added to the original x, yields a vector of zeros. The
bit pattern that does that is independent of the interpretation one may give
to it.
