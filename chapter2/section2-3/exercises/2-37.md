> You are given the task of patching the vulnerability in the XDR code shown in
the aside on page 100 for the case where both data types `int` and `size_t` are
32 bits. You decide to eliminate the possibility of the multiplication
overflowing by computing the number of bytes to allocate using data type
`uint64_t`. You replace the original call to `malloc` (line 9) as follows:
```c
uint64_t asize = ele_cnt * (uint64_t) ele_size;
void *result = malloc(asize);
```
> Recall that the argument to `malloc` has type `size_t`.

> A. Does your code provide any improvement over the original?

We can still overflow, since `asize` might hold larger values than `malloc`
accepts. When calling `malloc(asize)`, we do an implicit narrowing conversion
from `uint64_t` to `size_t`, which on 32-bit-word machines is 32 bits long,
therefore not enough to hold the full range of `asize` values.

> B. How would you change the code to eliminate the vulnerability?

Since `malloc` simply cannot take an argument with value larger than 2^32-1,
then I would do:
```c
if (!mulsize_t_ok((size_t)ele_cnt, ele_size)) {
    /* Array of elements is too large for this system */
    return NULL;
}
void *result = malloc((size_t)ele_cnt, ele_size);
```

Where `mulsize_t_ok` checks that its arguments can be multiplied without
overflowing type `size_t`, in the style of exercise 3.36.
