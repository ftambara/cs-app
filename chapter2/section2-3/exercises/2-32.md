> You are assigned the task of writing code for a function `tsub_ok`, with
arguments `x` and `y`, that will return 1 if computing `x-y` does not cause
overflow. Having just written the code for Problem 2.30, you write the
following:

```c
/* Determine whether arguments can be subtracted without overflow */
/* WARNING: This code is buggy. */
int tsub_ok(int x, int y) {
    return tadd_ok(x, -y);
}
```

> For what values of `x` and `y` will this function give incorrect results?
Writing a correct version of this function is left as an exercise
(Problem 2.74).

Due to the assimetry of the limits of type `int`, if `y == INT_MIN`, an `int`
cannot represent its opposite.
