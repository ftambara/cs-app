> Your coworker gets impatient with your analysis of the overflow conditions
for twoâ€™s-complement addition and presents you with the following
implementation of `tadd_ok`:

```c
/* Determine whether arguments can be added without overflow */
/* WARNING: This code is buggy. */
int tadd_ok(int x, int y) {
    int sum = x+y;
    return (sum-x == y) && (sum-y == x);
}
```

> You look at the code and laugh. Explain why.

Although we haven't officially seen subtraction in the book at this point,
my guess is that the subtraend is negated first, and the result of that is
added to the minuend. If this was the case, `tadd_ok` would always return 1,
since the mechanisms of overflow are associative and commutative:
```
sum-x == y
x + y - x = y == y
```
which is always true. The same argument applies to `sum-y == x`.
