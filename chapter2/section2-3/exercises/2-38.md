> As we will see in Chapter 3, the LEA instruction can perform computations of
the form (a<<k) + b, where k is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and b is either 0 or some
program value. The compiler often uses this instruction to perform
multiplications by constant factors. For example, we can compute `3*a` as
`(a<<1) + a`.
Considering cases where b is either 0 or equal to a, and all
possible values of k, what multiples of a can be computed with a single LEA
instruction?

```
(a<<k) yields a*2^k, for 0 <= k < sizeof(a)*8
b yields either a or 0
```
`(a<<k) + b` can compute any value in the set: `a*2^k U a*(2^k + 1)`

In addition to that we need to consider truncating the result to the size of
`a`.
