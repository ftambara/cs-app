> As mentioned in Problem 2.6, the integer 3,510,593 has hexadecimal
representation 0x00359141, while the single-precision floating-point number
3,510,593.0 has hexadecimal representation 0x4A564504. Derive this
floating-point representation and explain the correlation between the bits of
the integer and floating-point representations.

```
                        pos 21
                         v
0x00359141 = 0000 0000 0011 0101 1001 0001 0100 0001
```
The mantissa are all the bits after position 21, padded with two extra zeros
to the right to reach 23 bits:
`f = 10101100100010100000100`

When we normalized the mantissa, we had to shift the binary point 21 places.
With a bias of 127, `e = 21 + 127 = 138`
As an unsigned 8-bit number, this is: `10001010`

The sign bit is 0, because the original number is positive.

The full IEEE 754 representation is:
`0 10001010 10101100100010100000100`

We can see that the correlation is between bits in the mantissa of the
floating-point representation:
```
00000000001101011001000101000001
           *********************
  01000101010101100100010100000100
```
