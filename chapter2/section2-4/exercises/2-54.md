> Assume variables x, f, and d are of type int, float, and double, respectively.
Their values are arbitrary, except that neither f nor d equals +∞, −∞, or NaN.
For each of the following C expressions, either argue that it will always be
true (i.e., evaluate to 1) or give a value for the variables such that it is not
true (i.e., evaluates to 0).

> A. x == (int)(double) x

True.
Since there is no loss of information from `int` to `double`, and since
all that information by definition fits in an `int`, thus when converting
from `double` back bo `int` we get the original value.

> B. x == (int)(float) x

False.
There can be loss of information from `int` to float due to rounding.
Type `float` can represent integers of up to +/- 2^24 - 1.
If x == (2<<25) + 1, for instance, the expression will be false.

> C. d == (double)(float) d

False.
Converting `double` to `float` can lead to overflows or rounding errors.
If d == (double)(2<<25), the expression will be false.

> D. f == (float)(double) f

True.
Converting `float` to `double` can't lead to loss of information. All the
information in the resulting `double` will fit bach into a `float`.

> E. f == -(-f)

True.
There is no positive/negative range asymmetry in floating-point numbers.

> F. 1.0/2 == 1/2.0

True.
All values are converted to `float` before doing the operation.

> G. d*d >= 0.0

True.
Overflows will always lead to +∞.

> H. (f+d)-f == d

False.
f + d might lead to rounding. In that case, subtracting f back will not get
us back to d. For example, if f == FLOAT_MAX and d == 10
