> Show how the following binary fractional values would be rounded to the
nearest half (1 bit to the right of the binary point), according to the
round-to-even rule. In each case, show the numeric values, both before and
after rounding.

> A. 10.010
binary:     10.010  ->  10.0
decimal:     2.25   ->   2

> B. 10.011
binary:     10.011  -> 10.1
decimal:    2.375   ->  2.5

> C. 10.110
binary:     10.110  -> 11.0
decimal:    2.75    ->  3

> D. 11.001
binary:     11.001  -> 11.0
decimal:     3.125  ->  3
