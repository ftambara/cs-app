> We saw in Problem 2.46 that the Patriot missile software approximated 0.1 as
x = 0.00011001100110011001100_2. Suppose instead that they had used IEEE
round-to-even mode to determine an approximation x' to 0.1 with 23 bits to the
right of the binary point.

> A. What is the binary representation of x'?

Normalizing x into `M * 2^E`
```
0.1_10 = 0.000110011001100110011001100..._2
1.10011001100110011001100... * 2^-4
```

If we round the 23-rd bit after the binary point:
```
                    last bit
                      v
100110011001100110011001100... -> 10011001100110011001101
```

Calculate each component of `x_float`
```
bias = 127
e = -4 + 127 = 123_10 = 01111011

f = 10011001100110011001101

s = 0

x_float = 0 01111011 10011001100110011001101
          0 01111011 10011001100110011001101
```

> B. What is the approximate decimal value of x' − 0.1?

```
x' - 0.1 = 1.10011001100110011001101 * 2^-4
         = (110011001100110011001101 >> 4) >> 23
x' - 0.1 ≈ 1.490*10^-9
```

> C. How far off would the computed clock have been after 100 hours of
operation?

It would be approximately 536.4 μs ahead

> D. How far off would the program’s prediction of the position of the Scud
missile have been?

Using the same equation as in exercise 2.46:
```
2000 m/s * 536.4 μs ≈ 1.073 m
```

> Note: After re-reading the assignment I realized that the only part of the
IEEE standard that was mentioned was the round-to-even mode. I did the
exercise using the full IEEE 754 standard. I'm leaving this as it is, because
it was insightful.
