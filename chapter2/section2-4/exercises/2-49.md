> A. For a floating-point format with an n-bit fraction, give a formula for the
smallest positive integer that cannot be represented exactly (because it would
require an (n + 1)-bit fraction to be exact). Assume the exponent field size
k is large enough that the range of representable exponents does not provide a
limitation for this problem.

Such integer should have n+2 significant bits, since the implicit 1 nature of
the mantissa would allow it to represent up to an (n+1)-bit integer.
The smallest (n+2)-bit integer would have a 1, then n zeros, and another 1.
Its decimal value would be 2^(n+1)+1.

> B. What is the numeric value of this integer for single-precision format
(n = 23)?

`2^24 + 1 = 16777217`
