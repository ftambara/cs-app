> Armed with the function inplace_swap from Problem 2.10, you decide to write
code that will reverse the elements of an array by swapping elements from
opposite ends of the array, working toward the middle.
You arrive at the following function:

```c
void reverse_array(int a[], int cnt) {
    int first, last;
    for (first = 0, last = cnt-1;
         first <= last;
         first++,last--)
        inplace_swap(&a[first], &a[last]);
}
```

> When you apply your function to an array containing elements 1, 2, 3, and 4,
you find the array now has, as expected, elements 4, 3, 2, and 1. When you try
it on an array with elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, however, you are surprised to
see that the array now has elements 5, 4, 0, 2, and 1. In fact, you discover
that the code always works correctly on arrays of even length, but it sets the
middle element to 0 whenever the array has odd length.

> A. For an array of odd length cnt = 2k + 1, what are the values of variables
first and last in the final iteration of function reverse_array?

In the last iteration, when first == last, both have added or subtracted
an equal amount l:
```
0 + l = 2k - l
2l = 2k
l = k
```

Both will have value `k`

> B. Why does this call to function inplace_swap set the array element to 0?

If we analyze the operations:
```
*y = *x ^ *y = a ^ a = 0
```
The references x and y point to the location in memory. Changing *y also
changes *x. Therefore both *y = *x = 0

```
*x = *x ^ *y = 0
*y = *x ^ *y = 0
```

As a result, `&a[k]` is set to 0 if we call `inplace_swap(&a[k], &a[k])`.

> C. What simple modification to the code for reverse_array would eliminate
this problem?

I would change the for predicate to `first < last`. Or better yet, compare
agains `middle`, which is equal to `cnt/2`, instead of using last.
