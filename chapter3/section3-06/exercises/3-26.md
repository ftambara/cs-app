Since whe have an unconditional jump to the loop test part, the first
translation method was used.
For reference, that structure is:
```
    goto test;
loop:
    body-statement
test:
    t = test-expr;
    if (t)
        goto loop;
```

> B. Use the assembly-code version to fill in the missing parts of the C code.

```C
long fun_a(unsigned long x) {
    long val = 0;
    while (x != 0) {
        val = (val ^ x);
        x >>= 1;
    }
    return val & 1;
}
```

> C. Describe in English what this function computes.

On the first iteration, if `x != 0`, `val` is set to `x`. The last bit of `val`,
and therefore the last bit of `x`, is XORed against every other bit of `x`.
The last bit of `val` holds the parity of `x`, which is extracted by `val & 1`
in the return clause.
