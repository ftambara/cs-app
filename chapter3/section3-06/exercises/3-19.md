> A. What is the approximate miss penalty?

If we assume the highly predictable pattern was perfectly predictable, then
```
T_OK = 16
```
And in the random case:
```
T_rand = T_OK * .5 + (T_OK + T_miss) * .5
T_miss = 2*(T_rand - T_OK)
T_miss = 30
```
The miss penalty is at least 30 cycles

> B. How many cycles would the function require when the branch is mispredicted?

```
T_OK + T_miss = 46
```
It would require 46 cycles in that case
