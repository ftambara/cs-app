> In the following excerpts from a disassembled binary, some of the information
has been replaced by `X`â€™s. Answer the following questions about these
instructions.

> A. What is the target of the `je` instruction below? (You do not need to know
anything about the `callq` instruction here.)
> ```Assembly
> 4003fa: 74 02     je      XXXXXX
> 4003fc: ff d0     callq   *%rax

The target is `0x2 + 0x4003fc = 0x4003fe`.

> B. What is the target of the `je` instruction below?
> ```Assembly
> 40042f: 74 f4     je  XXXXXX
> 400431: 5d        pop %rbp
> ```

The target is `(0xf4 == -0xc) + 0x400431 = 0x400425`.

> C. What is the address of the `ja` and `pop` instructions?
> ```Assembly
> XXXXXX: 77 02     ja  400547
> XXXXXX: 5d        pop %rbp
> ```

The `pop` instruction address is `0x400547` - 0x2 = 0x400545`.
The `ja` address is `0x400545 - 0x2 = 0x400543` (2 bytes less).

> In the code that follows, the jump target is encoded in PC-relative form as a
4-byte two's-complement number. The bytes are listed from least significant to
most, reflecting the little-endian byte ordering of x86-64. What is the address
of the jump target?

The target is `(0xffffff73 == -0x8d) + 0x4005ed = 0x400560`
