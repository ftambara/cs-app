A function `fun_b` has the following overall structure:
```C
long fun_b(unsigned long x) {
    long val = 0;
    long i;
    for ( ...; ...; ...) {
        â‹®
    }
    return val;
}
```

The GCC C compiler generates the following assembly code:
```Assembly
    # long fun_b(unsigned long x)
    # x in %rdi
fun_b:
    movl    $64, %edx
    movl    $0, %eax
.L10:
    movq    %rdi, %rcx
    andl    $1, %ecx
    addq    %rax, %rax
    orq     %rcx, %rax
    shrq    %rdi        # Shift right by 1
    subq    $1, %rdx
    jne     .L10
    rep; ret
```
Reverse engineer the operation of this code and then do the following:

> A. Use the assembly-code version to fill in the missing parts of the C code.

```C
long fun_b(unsigned long x) {
    long val = 0;
    long i;
    for (i = 64; i >= 0; i--) {
        val = (val << 1) | (x & 1);
        x >>= 1;
    }
    return val;
}
```

> B. Explain why there is neither an initial test before the loop nor an initial
jump to the test portion of the loop.

The initial test can be avoided by noticing that `64 != 1` is always true. This
also allows the code to be rearranged as a do-while loop.

> C. Describe in English what this function computes.

After the first iteration, `val` holds the last bit of `x`, and `x` is shifted
once to the right. Each further iteration shifts `val` to the left, and adds the
next rightmost bit of `x`.
The result is that `val` holds the bits of `x` in reverse.
