In hex, the constants represent 0x0 and 0x40400000. Given the little-endiannes
of the example, this represents the floating point number 0x4040000000000000.
The sign is 0. The exponent bits are `0b100 0000 0100 = 4 + 2^10 = 1028`.
Subtracting the bias of `(1 << (11-1)) - 1 = 1023`, the exponent is 5.
The fractional part is 0. The mantissa is 1.
The encoded number is `1.0 * 2^5 = 32.0`
