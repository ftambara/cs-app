The constant is:
```
4294967295 = 0xffffffff
2147483647 = 0x7fffffff

xmm1 = 0x7fffffffffffffff
```
The return value is `x & 0x7fffffffffffffff`, which sets the sign bit to 0.
The operation calculates the absolute value of x.

> B.
> ```Assembly
> 1   vxorpd %xmm0, %xmm0, %xmm0
> ```

This calculates `x^x` which is always `+0.0`.

> C.
> ```Assembly
> 1       vmovsd  .LC2(%rip), %xmm1
> 2       vxorpd  %xmm1, %xmm0, %xmm0
> 3   .LC2:
> 4       .long   0
> 5       .long   -2147483648
> 6       .long   0
> 7       .long   0
> ```

The constant is:

```
-2147483648 = 0x7fffffff + 1 = 0x80000000

xmm1 = 0x8000000000000000
```
The calculation returns `x ^ 0x8000000000000000`. In a bitwise XOR against a
constant, zero-bits of the constant do nothing, while one-bits invert. This
operations changes the sign of x, effectively computing `-x`.
