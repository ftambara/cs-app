> A. How are complex arguments passed to a function?

It is clear that two xmm registers are used to pass complex arguments. The
lowest-numbered register (i.e. xmm0) contains the real part, while the other
(i.e. xmm1) contains the imaginary part.

> B. How are complex values returned from a function?

Complex values are returned in registers xmm0 (real part) and xmm1 (imaginary
part)
