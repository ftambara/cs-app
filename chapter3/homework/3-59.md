By expanding the hinted equations:
```
(1) p = 2^64 * ph + pl 
(2) p = (2^64 * xh + xl) * (2^64 * yh + yl)
p = 2^128 * xh * yh + 2^64 * (xh * yl + xl * yh) + xl * yl
```
Even though the term `2^128 * xh * yh` won't fit in 128, we can safely discard
it, since xh and yh are sign extentions and their product contains no
information.
```
(3) p = 2^64 * (xh * yl + xl * yh) + xl * yl
```
The only part of p that fits in the 64 low bits is:
```
pl = (xl * yl) % 2^64
```
which are the lower bits of `xl * yl`

In consequence, we can calculate `ph` as:
```
ph = (2^64 * (xh * yl + xl * yh) + (xl * yl - (xl * yl) % 2^64)) / (2^64)
```
The modulo term, being always smaller than 2^64, will always be 0 when divided
by 2^64.
```
ph = (xh * yl + xl * yh) + (xl * yl) >> (2^64)
```
The second term is effectively the higher order bits of `xl * yl`

```Assembly
1   store_prod:
2       movq    %rdx, %rax      rax = yl
3       cqto                    rdx = yh
4       movq    %rsi, %rcx      rcx = xl
5       sarq    $63, %rcx       rcx = xl >> 63 = xh
6       imulq   %rax, %rcx      rcx = xh * yl
7       imulq   %rsi, %rdx      rdx = xl * yh
8       addq    %rdx, %rcx      rcx = (xh * yl) + (xl * yh)
9       mulq    %rsi            rdx:rax = xl * yl
10      addq    %rcx, %rdx      rdx = (xh * yl) + (xl * yh) + upper bits of xl * yl
11      movq    %rax, (%rdi)    lower bits: (xl * yl) % 64
12      movq    %rdx, 8(%rdi)   higher bits = rdx
13      ret
```

Note that `xl >> 63 == xh`.
Both lower and higher order bits are exactly what was expected.
