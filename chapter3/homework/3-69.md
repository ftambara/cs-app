> A. The value of `CNT`.

Offsets:
```
first: 0
a: 4 + e1
last: 4 + e1 + Sa * CNT + e2

e1 is the padding after first
e2 is the padding after last
Sa is the size of a_struct
```

Constraints:
```
If Aa <= 4
    e1 = 0
Else:
    0 <= e1 < Aa

Aa is the alignment of a_struct
Aa = {0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16}

16 is the largest type size in C (that I know of)

If Aa >= 4:
    e2 = 0
Else:
    0 <= e2 < 4 - Aa

Sa >= Aa
```


```Assembly
2 mov    0x120(%rsi),%ecx         ecx = *(bp + 288)
3 add    (%rsi),%ecx              ecx = *bp + *(bp + 288)
4 lea    (%rdi,%rdi,4),%rax       rax = 5i
5 lea    (%rsi,%rax,8),%rax       rax = 40i + bp
6 mov    0x8(%rax),%rdx           rdx = *(40i + bp + 8)
7 movslq %ecx,%rcx                sign extend
8 mov    %rcx,0x10(%rax,%rdx,8)   *(40i + bp + 8rdx + 16) = rcx
9 retq
```

It's likely that lines 2 and 3 correspond to `int n = bp->first + bp->last`,
because it's the only addition of indirected values in both codes.
Since fist has offset 0, then the `offset(last) = 288`.

Line 8 is clearly doing the `ap->x[ap->idx] = n` line.
Given that ap contains members `x` and `idx`, one of the offsets for these
members must be larger than the other. Then it must be the case that `rdx`, from
line 6, stores the value of `&bp->a[i]`, while rcx on line 8 calculates the
offset of `ap->x[ap->idx]`. This indicates that `x` comes after `idx` in
`a_struct`.
It also indicates that the array `ap->x` has a type of size 8, which must be a
number given that we are assigning `n`. From the type conversion done on line 7,
we can deduce that `typeof(ap->x) = long`. This means that `Aa >= 8`.

Continuing with the reasoning above,
```
offset(ap->idx) = bp + i * Sa + offset(idx) + offset(a)
               = bp + i * Sa + offset(idx) + e1 + 4
```
Equating to line 6 calculations:
```
bp + i * Sa + offset(idx) + e1 + 4 = 40i + bp + 8
```
Since neither `offset(idx)` nor `e1` can depend on `i`,
```
Sa = 40
```

Then
```
offset(idx) + e1 = 4
0 <= e1 <= 4
```

Combining what we have so far with our constraints:
```
Aa = {8, 16}
e1 = {0, 1, 2, 4}
e2 = 0
4 + e1 + Sa * CNT + e2 = 288
e1 + 40 CNT = 284
```

With the additional restriction that `CNT` must be an even number, we try all
values of `e1` to get
```
e1 = 4
CNT = 7
```

Completing the equation for the offset of `a`'s member `idx`:
```
offset(idx) = 0

```
Looking at lines 6 and 8 again, we that by removing the increment necessary to
traverse array `ap->x`, The difference in offsets is 
```
offset(ap->x) - offset(ap->idx) = (40i + bp + 16) - (40i + bp + 8) = 8
offset(ap->x) - offset(ap->idx) = offset(x) - offset(idx) = 8
offset(x) = 8
```

> fields in this structure are `idx` and `x`, and that both of these contain
> signed values.

We only two unknowns left: the type of `idx` and the size of vector `x`.
From the size of `a_struct`, `Sa = 40`, we can solve for `len_x`:
```
Sa = offset(x) + len_x * sizeof(x)
40 = 8 + 8len_x
len_x = 4
```

For `idx`, we observe that on line 6, its value is stored in an 8 byte register.
Since `i` is of type `long` and `idx`, which is calculated from `i`, is never
truncated, we can assume that `idx` is a `long`.

```C
typedef struct {
    long idx;
    long x[4];
} a_struct;
```
