e1.p    0

If by structure it is meant the `union ele`, it is the largest size of the
embedded structs. Since both structs are of size 16, then
```
sizeof(union ele) = 16
```

```Assembly
   void proc (union ele *up) up in %rdi
1  proc:
2      movq 8(%rdi), %rax   rax = *(up + 8)
                            either *(e1.y) or *(e2.next)
                            rax = up->e2.next
3      movq (%rax), %rdx    rdx = *(up)
                            either *(e1), *(e1.p), *(e2), or *(e2.x)
                            rdx = up->e1.p
4      movq (%rdx), %rdx    rdx = *(up->e1.p)
5      subq 8(%rax), %rdx   rdx -= *(up->e2.next + 8)
                            rdx = *(up->e1.p) - up->e2.next->y
6      movq %rdx, (%rdi)    up->p = *(up->e1.p) - up->e2.next->y
7      ret
```

```C
void proc (union ele *up) {
    up->p = *(up->e1.p) - up->e2.next->y;
}
```
