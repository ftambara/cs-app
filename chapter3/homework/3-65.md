```Assembly
1  .L6:
2      movq  (%rdx), %rcx   rcx = *rdx
3      movq  (%rax), %rsi   rsi = *rax
4      movq  %rsi, (%rdx)   *rdx = rsi
5      movq  %rcx, (%rax)   *rax = rcx  // *rdx, *rax = *rax, *rdx
6      addq  $8, %rdx       rdx += 8
7      addq  $120, %rax     rax += 120
8      cmpq  %rdi, %rax     if (rax != rdi)
9      jne   .L6                loop
```

> A. Which register holds a pointer to array element `A[i][j]`?

Analyzing the inner loop, we notice that if we keep `i` constant, we can
use pointer arithmetic to loop through the matrix:
```C
long t = A[I][j];
A[I][j] = A[j][I];
A[j][I] = t;
```
Where `I` is a constant value of `i` for the whole loop.
We can see that incrementing `j` by one has the following effects:
- &A[I][j+1] = &A[I][j] + 8
- &A[j+1][I] = &A[j][I] + 8*M

This gives us enough information to say that register `rdx` holds a pointer to
`A[i][j]`.

> B. Which register holds a pointer to array element `A[j][i]`?

Continuing the previous analysis, we see that `rax` must hold a pointer to
`A[j][i]`.

> C. What is the value of `M`?

We already know that `8*M = 120`, so `M = 15`.
