> A. Explain, in mathematical terms, the logic in the computation of `s2`.

Starting from the address of `i`, the computation for the address of `s2` has
three parts:
```Assembly
5     leaq   30(,%rdi,8), %rax  # rax = 8n + 30
```
`8n` is the size of array `p`.

Add 30 to ensure that the min. `s2` (or more appropriately max.) will be
`rsp-16`, and that an array of size 8 bytes will start 32 bytes after `&i`.

```Assembly
6     andq   $-16, %rax         # rax = (8n + 30) & -0x10
```
Round down to nearest multiple of 16.

```Assembly
7     subq   %rax, %rsp
```
Calculate `s2`. `s2 - &i = {16,24}`.

> B. Explain, in mathematical terms, the logic in the computation of `p`.

```Assembly
8     leaq   15(%rsp), %r8  # r8 = rsp + 0b1111
9     andq   $-16, %r8      # r8 = rsp & -0b10000
```
After these two operations, `r8` will equal `rsp` rounded up to the nearest
multiple of 16.

> C. Find values of `n` and `s1` that lead to minimum and maximum values of
> `e1`.

```
e1 = p - s1
e1 = p - s2 + s2 - s1
e1 = e2 + (s2 - s1)
```

The second term will be maximized when `n` is odd. In that case `s2 - s1 = 24`.
It will be minimized when `n` is even. In that case `s2 - s1 = 16`.

The first term is equivalent to
```
e2 = s2 % 16
s2 = ((8n + 30) & -16) + s1
s2 % 16 = (((8n + 30) & -16) + s1) % 16
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            multiple of 16

s2 % 16 = s1 % 16
```
This will be maximized when `s1 % 16 = 15`, and minimized when `s1 % 16 = 0`.

Maximum:
```
n = 2k + 1      where k is a non-negative integer
s1 = 16l - 1    where l is a positive integer

Then e2 = 24 + 15 = 39
```

Minimum
```
n = 2k      where k is a non-negative integer
s1 = 16l    where l is a positive integer

Then e2 = 0
```

> D. What alignment properties does this code guarantee for the values of `s2`
> and `p`?

Both `s2` and `&p[0]` will always be on an address that's a multiple of 16.
