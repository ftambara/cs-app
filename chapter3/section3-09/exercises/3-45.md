| Field | Size | Offset |
|-------|------|--------|
| a     |    8 |      0 |
| b     |    2 |      8 |
| c     |    8 |     16 |
| d     |    1 |     24 |
| e     |    4 |     28 |
| f     |    1 |     32 |
| g     |    8 |     40 |
| h     |    4 |     48 |

> B. What is the total size of the structure?

```
Alignment = 8 bytes
Padding =  4 bytes
Total size = 56 bytes
```

```C
struct {
    char*   a;
    double  c;
    long    g;
    float   e;
    int     h;
    short   b;
    char    d;
    char    f;
} rec;
```

| Field | Size | Offset |
|-------|------|--------|
| a     |    8 |      0 |
| c     |    8 |      8 |
| g     |    8 |     16 |
| e     |    4 |     24 |
| h     |    4 |     28 |
| b     |    2 |     32 |
| d     |    1 |     34 |
| f     |    1 |     35 |

```
Alignment = 8 bytes
Padding = 4 bytes
Total size = 40 bytes
```
