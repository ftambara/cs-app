> The C code
> ```c

> shows a general comparison between arguments `a` and `b`, where `data_t`, the
data type of the arguments, is defined (via `typedef`) to be one of the integer
data types listed in Figure 3.1 and either signed or unsigned. The comparison
`COMP` is defined via `#define`.
Suppose `a` is in some portion of `%rdi` while `b` is in some portion of `%rsi`.
For each of the following instruction sequences, determine which data types
`data_t` and which comparisons `COMP` could cause the compiler to generate this
code. (There can be multiple correct answers; you should list them all.)


> A.
> ```Assembly
> cmpl  %esi, %edi
> setl  %al

- `data_t` is `int32_t`
- `COMP` is `<`


> B.
> ```Assembly
> cmpw   %si, %di
> setge  %al
> ```

- `data_t` is `int16_t`
- `COMP` is `>=`

> C.
> ```Assembly
> cmpb   %sil, %dil
> setbe  %al
> ```

- `data_t` is `unsigned char`
- `COMP` is `<=`

> D.
> ```Assembly
> cmpq   %rsi, %rdi
> setne  %al
> ```

- `data_t` is `int64_t` or `uint64_t`
- `COMP` is `!=`
