> For each of the following lines of assembly language, determine the appropriate
instruction suffix based on the operands. (For example, mov can be rewritten as
movb, movw, movl, or movq.)

```
movl    %eax, (%rsp)
movw    (%rax), %dx
movb    $0xFF, %bl
movb    (%rsp,%rdx,4), %dl
movq    (%rdx), %rax
movw    %dx, (%rax)
```
