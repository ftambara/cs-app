Due to the lines
```C
*u += a;
*v += b;
```
I assume `u` and `v` are pointers, while `a` and `b` are signed numbers.

While assembly-code lines:
```Assembly
3   addq    %rdi, (%rdx)
4   addb    %sil, (%rcx)
```

Given that on line 2 we sign-extend a 4-byte number on the first argument,
to an 8-byte number, and add that to the number pointed by the third,
we can say that:
- The first argument is an `int` (or `int32_t`)
- The third argument is a `long*` (or `int64_t`)
- The first and third arguments are added together.

Line 5 shows that the size of both numbers add to 6. Solving the equation:
- The second argument is a `short` (or `int16_t`)

Line 4 shows that only the last bytes of the second and fourth arguments are
of interest:
- The fourth argument is a `char*` (or `int8_t*`)
- The second and fourth arguments are added together.

This leaves open only two solutions:
```C
int a;
short b;
long *u;
char *v;
```

Or, since same-kind variable names are interchangeable (numbers and pointers):
```C
int b;
short a;
long *v;
char *u;
```
