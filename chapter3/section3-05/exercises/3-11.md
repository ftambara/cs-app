Doing the xor operation of a value with itself always yields 0. This is a way
to put a zero on the register. It's likely more efficient than using
`movl $0, %ecx`, for example

assembly code?

As mentioned above: `movl $0, %ecx`

> C. Compare the number of bytes to encode these two different implementations
of the same operation.

According to Intel's manual:
```
movl $0, %ecx: B8+ rd id
```
Assembles to: `B9 00 00 00 00`

```
xorq %rcx, %rcx: REX.W + 31 /r
```
Assembles to: 48 31 C9

We can see that the `xor` version uses 2 fewer bytes (3 vs 5) than using `mov`.
