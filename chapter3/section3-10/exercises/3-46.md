> C. To what address does the program attempt to return?

The program attemps to return to address `0x343332313039`, likely outside of the
reserved memory for the program.

> D. What register(s) have corrupted value(s) when `get_line` returns?

The value of `rbx`, which should be callee saved, is corrupted.

> E. Besides the potential for buffer overflow, what three other things are wrong
> with the code for `get_line`?

- `strlen` does not include the null character, yet `strcpy` will attempt to
  copy the terminating caracter into result, resulting in segfault.
- It never whether `malloc` fails to allocate memory for `result`.
- Apparently, it is always the case that `sizeof(char) == 1`, but there is
  practically no cost in doing `malloc(sizeof(char) * strlen(buf));` just to be
  sure.
