> A. For both versions: What are the positions in the stack frame for `buf`,
> `v`, and (when present) the canary value?

For case (a), `buf` is at position `-40`, `v` is at position `-40 + 24 = -16`,
and the canary value is not present.
For case (b), `buf` is at position `-56 + 16 = -40`, `v` is at position
`-56 + 8 = -48`, and the canary value is at position `-56 + 40 = -16`.
All values are relative to the end of the previous stack frame address.

> B. How does the rearranged ordering of the local variables in the protected
> code provide greater security against a buffer overrun attack?

Diagrams:
```
Case (a)
----------------| 0: Previous stack pointer
v v v v v v v v |
v v v v v v v v | -16: v
b b b b b b b b |
b b b b b b b b |
b b b b b b b b | -40: buf

Case (b)
----------------| 0: Previous stack pointer
c c c c c c c c |
c c c c c c c c | -16: Canary value
b b b b b b b b |
b b b b b b b b |
b b b b b b b b | -40: buf
v v v v v v v v | -48: v
```

The case (b) diagram shows that in case (b), any overflow of `buf` that steps on
a reserved section of the stack will be detected (even though there is some
extra space for `buf` compared to what was actually requested).
