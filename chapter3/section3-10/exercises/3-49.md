```Assembly
5   leaq    22(,%rdi,8), %rax
6   andq    $-16, %rax
7   subq    %rax, %rsp          # Allocate space for array p (%rsp = s2)
```

Computation:
```
rax = 22 + 8n = 22 + (n << 3)
rax = rax & -16 = rax & 0xff ff ff ff ff ff ff f0
rsp = rsp - rax
```
I ignore why we are using 22 instead of 16, since the rest of the bits are
zeroed anyways. I see only a very contrived way of doing `(8n + 16)`.

The logical AND with -16 rounds `rax` **down** to the nearest multiple of 16.

The operation `(8n + 16) & -16` (just like `(8n + 22) & -16`), computes
`8n + 16` if `n` is even, or `8n + 8` if `n` is odd.

```Assembly
8   leaq    7(%rsp), %rax
9   shrq    $3, %rax
10  leaq    0(,%rax,8), %r8     # Set %r8 to &p[0]
```

Computation:
```
rax = rsp + 7
rax = rax >> 3
r8 = 8 * rax = ((rsp + 7) >> 3) << 3
```

This one simply:
1. Divides `rsp` by 8, rounding up to the next integer (by using the biasing
   technique seen in chapter 2)
2. Multiplies `rsp` by 8.

The result is rounding `rsp` **up** to the nearest multiple of 8.

For `n = 5`:
```
rax = 8 * n + 22 = 62 = 0x3e
rax = rax & -16 = 0x30 = 48
s2 = rsp - 48 = 2065 - 48 = 2017
rax = rsp + 7 = 2024
rax = 2024 >> 3 = 253
p = r8 = rax << 3 = 2024
e1 = s1 - (p + 8 * n) = 2065 - (2024 + 40) = 1
e2 = p - s2 = 0
```

For `n = 6`:
```
rax = 8 * n + 22 = 70 = 0x46
rax = rax & -16 = 0x40 = 64
s2 = rsp - 64 = 2064 - 64 = 2000
rax = rsp + 7 = 2007
rax = 2007 >> 3 = 250
p = r8 = rax << 3 = 2000
e1 = s1 - (p + 8 * n) = 2064 - (2000 + 48) = 16
e2 = p - s2 = 0
```

| n |  s1  |  s2  |   p  | e1 | e2 |
|:-:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:--:|:--:|
| 5 | 2065 | 2024 | 2024 |  1 |  0 |
| 6 | 2064 | 2000 | 2000 | 16 |  0 |

> D. What alignment properties does this code guarantee for the values of `s2`
> and `p`?

This code will always align `s2` to smallest multiple of 16 that gives enough
space for the necessary space and aligmnent constrains of the frame. Relative to
`s2`, `p` will be the largest multiple of 8 where `p >= s2`.
