```
a: 0
b: 8
c: 16
d: 24
e: 28
f: 32
g: 40
h: 48
```

```
Alignment = 8 bytes
Padding =  4 bytes
Total size = 52 bytes
```

```C
struct {
    char*   a;
    double  c;
    long    g;
    float   e;
    int     h;
    short   b;
    char    d;
    char    f;
} rec;
```

```
a: 0
c: 8
g: 16
e: 24
h: 28
b: 32
d: 34
f: 35

Alignment = 8 bytes
Padding = 0 bytes
Total size = 36 bytes
```
