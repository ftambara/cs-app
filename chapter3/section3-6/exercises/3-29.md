> A. What would we get if we naively applied our rule for translating the `for`
loop into a `while` loop? What would be wrong with this code?

Using the jump-to-middle strategy:
```
    init-expr;
    goto test;
loop:
    if (i & 1)
        goto loop;  # We would skip evaluating the update expression
    update-expr;
test:
    t = test-expr;
    if (t)
        goto loop;
```

> B. How could you replace the `continue` statement with a `goto` statement to
ensure that the `while` loop correctly duplicates the behavior of the `for`
loop?

```C
long sum = 0;
long i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    if (i & 1) {
        goto update;
    }
    sum += i;
update:
    i++;
}
```
