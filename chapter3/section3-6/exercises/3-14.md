> shows a general comparison between argument `a` and 0, where we can set the
data type of the argument by declaring `data_t` with a `typedef`, and the nature
of the comparison by declaring `TEST` with a `#define` declaration. The
following instruction sequences implement the comparison, where `a` is held in
some portion of register `%rdi`. For each sequence, determine which data types
`data_t` and which comparisons `TEST` could cause the compiler to generate this
code. (There can be multiple correct answers; list all correct ones.)

> A.
> ```Assembly
> testq %rdi, %rdi

- `data_t` is `int64_t`
- `TEST` is `>=`

> B.
> ```Assembly
> testw %di, %di
> sete  %al
> ```

- `data_t` is either `int16_t` or `uint16_t`
- `TEST` is `==`

> C.
> ```Assembly
> testb %dil, %dil
> seta  %al
> ```

- `data_t` is `unsigned char`
- `TEST` is `!=` or `>`

> D.
> ```Assembly
> testl %edi, %edi
> setle %al
> ```

- `data_t` is `int32_t`
- `TEST` is `<=`
