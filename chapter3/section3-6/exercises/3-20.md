> A. What operation is OP?

Translating the code to C
```C
long arith(long x) {
    return ((x >= 0) ? x : x + 7) >> 3;
}
```
Recalling from chapter 2, this is the logic that's done in divisions when
rounding towards zero. Therefore, the 7 is the bias, the shift divides by 8,
and the operation is `x / 8`.

Response:
```C
#define OP /
```

> B. Annotate the code to explain how it works.

```Assembly
arith:
    leaq    7(%rdi), %rax   # res = x + 7
    testq   %rdi, %rdi      # Set ZF and SF according to x & x
    cmovns  %rdi, %rax      # (x >= 0) ? (res = x)
    sarq    $3, %rax        # res >> 3
    ret
```
