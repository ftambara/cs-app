> A. Rewrite the goto version of `absdiff_se` based on this alternate rule.

```c
long gotodiff_se(long x, long y) {
    long result;
    if (x < y) {
        goto x_lt_y;
    }
    ge_cnt++;
    result = x - y;
    return result;
x_lt_y:
    lt_cnt++;
    result = y - x;
    return result;
}
```

> B. Can you think of any reasons for choosing one rule over the other?

Compared to the form:
```
    t = test-expr;
    if (!t)
        goto false;
    then-statement
    goto done;
false:
    else-statement
done:
```

The alternate form might be more straight_forward to think about, since we
don't have to invert test predicates.
